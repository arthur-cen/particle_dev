## Plant Mario
A plant can sing your favorite Mario song to you!

## Solution

Plant  Create a plant that sing song
add energy to owner's life
let owner be aware of it is getting enough sunshine
Will push notification to user if the light value is too low

## Approach
Identified the key feature of the device.
Thought about what signal it need to give to the user.
Thought about how user would like to get notified when the plant condition needs care.
Added a little touch for the user to increase the vividness of the plant.

## Process
Process: You should maintain a record of your work as it progresses. This should include: components used, photos and videos of the circuits assembled, code (and versions of your code), reflections and challenges encountered, how you solved problems, iterated etc. Be able to tell the story of your work.

Tried to use LED screen but not working, and decided to use the basic logic to show the led lights.
Code are assembled from each exercises.

## Technical Documentation
Technical Documentation: Be able to illustrate the final outcome and how you prodcued it. Your documentation for this section must include:
### Circuit Diagram

### Code
please refer to repository

### Parts needed


### Demo

## Next Steps
In the next step, I will improve the richness of the environmental information collected by the device that can help the plant to grow more. First, it will be a realy plant instead of a mockup. Secondy, I will add more sensors to collect more information that are related to the plant's growth. Thirdly, the plant will be able to water itself with soil moisture data collected. There will be a  more user friendly dashboard for user to monitor the plant status.

## Reflection


## Reference
Completed code
A circuit diagram (use Fritzing or similar)
A list of parts
A video of your completed project (use in context, operation, etc.)
You are welcome to include illustrative diagrams (workflow, etc.), additional photos, or a concept video.

Next Steps: What would you do if you took this project forward and why?

Reflection: Reflect on the challenges you encountered and the process as a whole. Did you get where you wanted to? If so, great. If not, why not? What do you need to get there, etc?

References: Include any sources (precedents, projects, literature, etc.) relevant to the project and referenced in the text.
